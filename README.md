# disboard-i18n
Translation files for [Disboard](https://disboard.org). `locales` folder is for the bot, while `messages` folder is for the website. This repository is placed under my management as permitted by Taki, the owner of Disboard. Just follow the **Japanese or English file** (`ja` or `en`) and do a PR to contribute. Have fun translating xd
